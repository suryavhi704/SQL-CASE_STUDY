# SQL & T-SQL Case Study 🚀

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains an in-depth case study conducted on three normalized datasets, where various SQL and T-SQL operations were applied. The study encompasses a wide range of database functionalities, including **DDL, DML, DQL, and TCL commands**, along with **T-SQL-specific operations** such as stored procedures, case conditions, transaction operations, and functions.

## 🎯 Features
- **Comprehensive SQL Operations:**
  - ✅ Data Definition Language (DDL)
  - ✅ Data Manipulation Language (DML)
  - ✅ Data Query Language (DQL)
  - ✅ Transaction Control Language (TCL)
- **Advanced T-SQL Techniques:**
  - 🔹 Stored Procedures
  - 🔹 Case Conditions
  - 🔹 Transaction Operations
  - 🔹 User-Defined Functions
- **Execution of 25 Thought-Provoking Questions** designed to extract valuable insights from datasets using SQL queries.

## 🔍 Questions Addressed

2. Count the number of products that are of regular type.
3. Find the total marketing spending for `Product ID 1`.
4. Retrieve the minimum sales of a product.
5. Display the maximum Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).
6. Get details of the product where the product type is coffee.
7. Retrieve details where total expenses exceed 40.
8. Calculate the average sales in area code 719.
9. Find the total profit generated by the state of Colorado.
10. Display the average inventory for each `Product ID`.
11. List states in sequential order in the `LocationTable`.
12. Display the average budget of products where the average budget margin is greater than 100.
13. Calculate total sales made on `2010-01-01`.
14. Find the average total expense of each `Product ID` on an individual date.
15. Display a table with attributes: `date, productID, product_type, product, sales, profit, state, area_code`.
16. Rank sales-wise without any gaps.
17. Find state-wise profit and sales.
18. Retrieve state-wise profit and sales along with product names.

20. **[Skipped in the given list]**
21. Create a stored procedure to fetch results based on `Product Type` from the `Product Table`.
22. Write a query with a condition: If total expenses are less than 60, classify as profit; otherwise, classify as a loss.
23. Get the total weekly sales value with `date` and `Product ID` details, using ROLL-UP for hierarchical data retrieval.
24. Display `date, product ID, and sales` where total expenses fall between 100 and 200.
25. **Delete the records in the `Product Table` for regular type.**
